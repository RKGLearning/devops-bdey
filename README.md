This is Main Branch.
This I am explaining difference between commit and push.

When you perform commit , it commits all your changes to local.
When you perform push , it publish all your commit changes to remote github repositiory.



Always Steps to follow :

1. Git clone
2. If needed swithch the branch using git checkout.
3. Work on the changes locally.
4. Add those changes using git add . (. for all) or git add <File Name> for specific file.
5. Commit your changes with specific message for publishing it to github.
6. Use git push to publish your changes on remote github repositiory.
7. if you want to pull the changes from remote , use git pull .
